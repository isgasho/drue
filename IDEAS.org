#+TITLE: IDEAS for future improvements

* [0/8] Improvements
** TODO for the stepwise algorithms make the reversion to the basic color slower to make it feel more impactful
** TODO implement sequence tracking. so it does something after you do the sequence
** TODO simple hit to state send algorithm
** TODO add a little drum roll when successfully connected
** TODO hit strength algorithm
** TODO add the option for the base color to be a colorloop
** TODO give a bpm and estimate the respones time from that
** TODO add a fallback pause function to an algorithm to handle failed request sends

* [0/6] Ideas that need a quick think
** TODO WHY estimate per minute?
** TODO account for gammut?
** TODO Perhaps add a way to specify which lights an algorithm affects (Option Some([u8])/None (all))
** TODO Following from the previous point, think about composition of algorithms into an AlgoCollection (its own execute)
** TODO implement loop in run so u can feed a set of algorithms
** TODO somehow implement cutomisable states ? State trait ?
