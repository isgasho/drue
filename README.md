# Drue

This is a tool to adjust hue lights based on drumming speed and BPM form an
electric drumkit connected through MIDI.

## Dependencies

It mainly needs the `hue client` currently I rely on the client to communicate
with the lights and the main `MIDI` logic is abstracted in the package.

If people want to contribute and actually develop a HUE layer for rust that
isn't out of date, feel free to do it.
